# MODELLING & ANALYSIS OF THE USAGE OF A MOBILE APPLICATION

## This repo looks to explore the usage patterns on the RPGLite data set. 

### This is a Level 4 individual project at the University of Glasgow

The research aims to find differences in usage styles with the RPGLite game data.

RPGLite is a multiplayer mobile game that was created for research purposes and gather data on players for further analysis

The data set is linked here: [RPGLite data set](https://researchdata.gla.ac.uk/1070/)


## This repo has the tools needed to:
 - Parse the data set into the correct format needed for running the Expectation Maximisation Algorithm on it
 - Remove unnecessary data from the data set including game history and player stats
 - Remove outliers in the data set
 - Output descriptive statistics on the data set
 - Provide a utility of converting PRISM json outputs into an organised folder structure
 - Present PRISM outputs into human readable results

The [manual.md](src/manual.md) file includes a description on the usage of the tools required and instructions on how to use the tools
